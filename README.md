# NBA MVP Analysis

## Overview

This paper examines the methodology behind the NBAâ€™s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, introducing the MVP Index as a data-driven measure to evaluate player performance. The MVP Index combines key statistics, including points, assists, rebounds, and win shares, to provide a comprehensive metric of value. Using historical data and statistical modeling, we identify discrepancies between actual MVP winners and those with the highest MVP Index, highlighting the influence of narrative and qualitative factors on voting outcomes. The findings underscore the need for greater transparency and consistency in the MVP selection process while offering a framework for more objective evaluations.
